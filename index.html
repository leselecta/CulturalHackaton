      <h2>How can art and culture promote urban regeneration processes
        for places on the outskirts of the city?</h2>

          <div style="margin-bottom:2.5rem;"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1SSxn02kjx61MR079zM12MUhtLjbS48c9vbA7nr_ihoE/viewform?edit_requested=true" target="_blank" class="button" ><i class="fas fa-sign-in-alt"></i> &nbsp; Book Now</a></div>
      
      
    <p> Urban regeneration is a virtuous process that operates in an integrated way on the physical space, on the community and on policies, transforming the outskirts, characterized by physical, relational and social voids, giving them a new sense of centrality, inhabited by communities able to become promoters of their own change.</p>
    <p> The enhancement and enrichment of local cultural capital can lead to an increase in social capital and promote processes of collective intelligence, thus stimulating the development of the community, its capacity for self-promotion and the construction of new centralities.</p>
    <p>To enhance, we need to know.<br>
      To enrich, it is necessary to transform together, looking for new cultural contributions and reflections.</p>
    <p>LARU Urban Regeneration Workshop 2017/2018 intends to deepen the analysis and reflection on how art and culture can stimulate the local population in the regeneration processes of the suburbs, as marginal areas of the city with an important presence of public housing and with problems of social and economic nature, or abandoned areas of strong interest to be converted for a strategic vision of territorial development.</p>
    <p>The objective of the #culturalhackathon event is centred on hacking, that is, exploring good practices, new ideas and creating innovative systems for the promotion of cultural capital located in processes of "urban regeneration" of marginal places of the city.</p>

        <h4>Lara Trevisan</h4>
        <p>Lara Trevisan  is developing site-specific interventions of street-art, applying to urban walls and pavements large format photographs which interact with the environment that hosts them and with the gaze of the observer: for example open windows which offer to the eye new spaces where one can imagine to run freely (Fontainebleau, 2010), pools in which to dive and resurface from (Piscina, 2013), future scenarios where a humanised Nature reclaims the landscape (Quarto Scenario, 2015). <br>
          The spectator becomes the protagonist: he can identify himself with the images and can physically interact with them by treading, entering or sitting on them.</p>

        <h4>Michele Tajariol</h4>
        <p>His early research led him to confront the language of sculpture through the use of objects that decontextualize spaces or affective places. An idea of sculpture of composition with different materials and common objects.<br>
          The identity of sculpture-object has shifted the language of the artist for a performative and photographic purpose, in which he compares body and work for a single objectivity of visual synthesis. The use of different languages erases the expressive self-referentiality and opens the work towards collaborations with other artists</p>
